  <Card title="📄️Concurrency and Sharding GuideOne way to accelerate execution of a large test suite is to run multiple tests concurrently instead of sequentially. Testpilot gives you two independent levers for speeding up a suite: running multiple tests at once on a single worker (concurrency) and slicing the suite across multiple workers (sharding).
