## What is Testpilot?[​](#what-is-testpilot "Direct link to What is Testpilot?")

Testpilot uses generative AI and image recognition to simulate real user interactions with your applications. Unlike traditional testing frameworks that rely on brittle selectors or complex code, Testpilot navigates your app visually, just like your users do.

Key features include:

* **No-code test creation**: Describe your test in plain English and Testpilot handles the rest
* **Visual testing**: Tests your app the way real users see it, not through code selectors
* **Intelligent Testing**: Automatically adapts to changes, pop-ups, and other flows that confuse traditional test automation.
* **Comprehensive reporting**: Visual reports with screenshots and videos of test runs
* **Cross-platform testing**: Works across web browsers, as well as Android and iOS apps

## How Testpilot Works[​](#how-testpilot-works "Direct link to How Testpilot Works")

Testpilot combines OpenAI's large language models with browser automation to create a testing system that understands your application at a human level:

1. You describe test scenarios in simple YAML files called "pilot plans"
2. Testpilot interprets your test steps and translates them into actions
3. The AI agent navigates your app visually, taking screenshots to understand the UI
4. It executes the test steps, adapting to what it sees on screen
5. A detailed report is generated with screenshots, videos, and results

## Why Use Testpilot?[​](#why-use-testpilot "Direct link to Why Use Testpilot?")

Traditional testing approaches often suffer from:

* High maintenance costs as UIs change
* Brittle selectors that break easily
* Complicated setup and coding requirements
* Difficulty testing visual aspects of applications

Testpilot solves these problems by using AI to understand your application visually and adapt to changes automatically. This results in more reliable tests that require less maintenance and can be created without specialized testing knowledge.
