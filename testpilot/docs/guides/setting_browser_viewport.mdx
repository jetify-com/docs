## Why Configure Viewports?[​](#why-configure-viewports "Direct link to Why Configure Viewports?")

Configuring viewports allows you to:

* Test responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes
* Verify that UI elements appear correctly at different resolutions
* Ensure your application is usable on various devices
* Catch layout issues that only appear at specific dimensions

## Configuring Viewports in Your Pilot File[​](#configuring-viewports-in-your-pilot-file "Direct link to Configuring Viewports in Your Pilot File")

You can define viewports at the test case level using the `viewports` field. Here's how to set it up:

```
cases:  - id: "responsive-test-001"    name: "Homepage Responsive Test"    description: "Verify the homepage displays correctly on multiple devices"    url: "https://example.com"    viewports:      - name: "Desktop"        size: [1920, 1080]      - name: "Tablet"        size: [768, 1024]      - name: "Mobile"        size: [375, 667]    steps:      - "Verify the navigation menu is visible"      - "Verify the hero image is displayed properly"      - "Scroll down to check content layout"
```

Each viewport configuration consists of:

* `name`: A descriptive name for the viewport (e.g., "Desktop", "Tablet", "Mobile")
* `size`: An array of two integers representing width and height in pixels

## How Testpilot Uses Viewports[​](#how-testpilot-uses-viewports "Direct link to How Testpilot Uses Viewports")

When you define multiple viewports for a test case, Testpilot will:

1. Run the test case once for each viewport configuration
2. Resize the browser window to match each viewport's dimensions before starting the test
3. Take screenshots and generate reports that show how your site appears at each size
4. Identify any issues specific to particular screen sizes

## Common Viewport Sizes[​](#common-viewport-sizes "Direct link to Common Viewport Sizes")

Here are some commonly used viewport sizes for different device categories:

### Desktop[​](#desktop "Direct link to Desktop")

```

```
viewports:  - name: "Mobile Large"    size: [428, 926]  # iPhone 13 Pro Max  - name: "Mobile Medium"    size: [390, 844]  # iPhone 13 Pro  - name: "Mobile Small"    size: [375, 667]  # iPhone SE
```

```
## Tips for Viewport Testing1. **Start with key breakpoints**: Focus on testing the major breakpoints where your UI changes significantly2. **Test critical user flows**: Ensure important user journeys work on all screen sizes3. **Consider device-specific behaviors**: Some features might work differently on touch devices versus desktop4. **Test orientation changes**: For tablet and mobile viewports, consider testing both portrait and landscape orientations5. **Check for overflow issues**: Verify that content doesn't overflow or get cut off at smaller screen sizesBy thoroughly testing your application across different viewports, you can ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience for all your users, regardless of the device they're using.
