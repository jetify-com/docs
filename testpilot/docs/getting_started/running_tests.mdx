## Step 1: Write a Simple Test[​](#step-1-write-a-simple-test "Direct link to Step 1: Write a Simple Test")

Testpilot runs tests that are written in a pilotplan format. For this example we'll use YAML, but Testpilot can also recognize pilot files written in TOML or JSON:

Here is a simple test that will go to Hacker News, search for a topic, and click the first result.

Copy these contents to a yaml file titled `example-hn-search.pilot.yaml`.

```
name: "Hacker News Search Test"# List of Cases to Executecases:  - id: "testcase_01jy2m0vh8f05vv5qmkkxf6zxt"    name: "Search for Devbox on Hacker News"    description: "Navigate to news.ycombinator.com, search for Devbox, and click the first search result"    url: "https://news.ycombinator.com"    # List of Test Steps    steps:      - "Use the search bar on the front page to search for Devbox"      - "Verify search results for 'Devbox' are displayed"      - "Click on the first search result link"      - "Verify the clicked post or article has loaded correctly"
```

Tests are provided to Testpilot as a list of `cases`, where each case executres one or more `steps`. When Testpilot executes a test case, it opens the `url` of the test case in a new browser or device context, and begins executing the `steps`.

## Step 2: Running your Test[​](#step-2-running-your-test "Direct link to Step 2: Running your Test")

You can run your test files using `testpilot test <path_to_file>`. Testpilot runs your tests in headless mode by default, but you can use `--show-browser` to watch what Testpilot is doing live:

```
testpilot test example-hn-search.pilot.yaml --show-browser
```

Testpilot will launch the browser and begin executing your testplan live. You can view the LLM's actions and reasoning in your terminal:

```

```

## Step 3: Viewing your Test Results[​](#step-3-viewing-your-test-results "Direct link to Step 3: Viewing your Test Results")

Once your test is finished, a static HTML report with the results, screenshots, and video of the test will be written to `testpilot-out`. You can view the results by opening the index.html at the root of the folder:

```
open testpilot-out/index.html
```
