title: "Generating Tests"
description: "Testpilot can automatically generate test plans based on your prompt description, saving you the time and effort of writing tests manually. This feature leverages AI to create comprehensive test scenarios that you can run or use as a starting point for your own tests."

<Info>
  This feature is experimental. It may generate erroneous or incorrect tests, and you should review any tests before executing or checking them in.

## Why Generate Tests?[​](#why-generate-tests "Direct link to Why Generate Tests?")

Manually writing test cases can be time-consuming and may miss important scenarios. Testpilot's test generation capability helps by:

* Creating test plans much faster than manual authoring
* Discovering edge cases you might not have considered
* Providing comprehensive coverage of your application
* Standardizing test structure and approach
* Reducing the expertise required to create quality tests

## Generating Your First Test[​](#generating-your-first-test "Direct link to Generating Your First Test")

To generate tests, use the `testpilot generate` command followed by a prompt that describes what you want to test:

```
testpilot generate "Visit nixhub.com and search for 'go'. Verify that version 1.24 is shown"
```

This command:

1. Processes your prompt using AI
2. Generates a comprehensive test plan in YAML format
3. Saves the test plan to a file in the current directory

You should see something like the following output in a `generated.pilot.yaml` file:

```
schema_version: v1.0.0name: nullcases:    - id: testcase_01jy56bqacey0vdkt9qtje76q6      name: Verify version 1.24 of 'go' on nixhub.com      description: Users need to find the package 'go' on nixhub.com and ensure that version 1.24 is listed among the search results.      steps:        - Enter 'go' into the search bar.        - Look for search results related to 'go'.        - Verify that version 1.24 of 'go' is displayed in the search results.      url: https://nixhub.com      context:        - text: Visit nixhub.com and search for 'go'. Verify that version 1.24 is shown
```

For best results, include:

* The URL of the application you want to test
* Specific features or flows you want to test
* Any edge cases or scenarios to include

## Adding Context for Better Tests[​](#adding-context-for-better-tests "Direct link to Adding Context for Better Tests")

You can provide additional context to improve test generation quality using the `--context` flag:

```
testpilot generate "Test the checkout process" --context ./api-docs.md --context ./checkout-flow.txt
```

The context files can include:

* API documentation
* User flow descriptions
* Existing test examples
* Application requirements
* Known edge cases

You can specify multiple context files to provide more comprehensive information.

## Customizing Output Location[​](#customizing-output-location "Direct link to Customizing Output Location")

By default, generated tests are saved to the current directory. You can specify a different output directory:

```
testpilot generate "Test search functionality" --outdir ./tests/search
```

## Example: Generated Test Plan[​](#example-generated-test-plan "Direct link to Example: Generated Test Plan")

Here's an example of a test plan generated from a prompt:

```
name: "Login Functionality Test Suite"context:  - text: "This test suite verifies the login functionality of the example.com website"  - text: "The login page has fields for username and password, plus a 'Remember me' checkbox"cases:  - id: "login-success-001"    name: "Successful Login"    description: "Verify that users can successfully log in with valid credentials"    url: "https://example.com/login"    steps:      - "Navigate to the login page"      - "Verify the login form is displayed with username and password fields"      - "Enter a valid username in the username field"      - "Enter a valid password in the password field"      - "Click the 'Log in' button"      - "Verify successful login by checking for the user dashboard"      - "Verify the username is displayed in the header area"  - id: "login-failure-001"    name: "Failed Login - Invalid Password"    description: "Verify appropriate error message when login fails due to invalid password"    url: "https://example.com/login"    steps:      - "Navigate to the login page"      - "Enter a valid username in the username field"      - "Enter an invalid password in the password field"      - "Click the 'Log in' button"      - "Verify an error message is displayed"      - "Verify the user remains on the login page"  - id: "login-remember-me-001"    name: "Remember Me Functionality"    description: "Verify the 'Remember me' option maintains login session across browser restarts"    url: "https://example.com/login"    steps:      - "Navigate to the login page"      - "Enter valid login credentials"      - "Check the 'Remember me' checkbox"      - "Click the 'Log in' button"      - "Verify successful login"      - "Close the browser and reopen it"      - "Navigate to https://example.com"      - "Verify the user is still logged in without re-entering credentials"
```

## Modifying Generated Tests[​](#modifying-generated-tests "Direct link to Modifying Generated Tests")

Testpilot generates a starting point for your tests, but you should:

1. **Review the tests**: Carefully review all generated test cases
2. **Edit as needed**: Adjust steps to match your application's actual behavior
3. **Add specificity**: Make vague steps more specific when necessary
4. **Add assertions**: Ensure there are clear verification steps
5. **Remove irrelevant tests**: Delete test cases that don't apply to your application

## Running Generated Tests[​](#running-generated-tests "Direct link to Running Generated Tests")

After reviewing and adjusting the generated tests, run them with:

```
testpilot test path/to/generated-test.pilot.yaml
```

## Effective Test Generation Prompts[​](#effective-test-generation-prompts "Direct link to Effective Test Generation Prompts")

For the best results, create detailed, specific prompts:

**Basic Prompt:**

```
Test the login functionality at https://example.com
```

**Better Prompt:**

```
Test the login functionality at https://example.com including:- Successful login with valid credentials- Failed login with incorrect password- Failed login with non-existent user- Password reset flow- Remember me functionality- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
```

## Best Practices for Generated Tests[​](#best-practices-for-generated-tests "Direct link to Best Practices for Generated Tests")

1. **Be specific in your prompts**: The more detail you provide, the better the generated tests
2. **Include application URLs**: Always specify the URL to test in your prompt
3. **Provide context files**: Add relevant documentation to improve generation quality
4. **Review before running**: Always review generated tests before execution
5. **Customize as needed**: Treat generated tests as a starting point, not the final product
6. **Version control**: Save and version your refined test files

By using Testpilot's test generation capabilities, you can quickly create a solid foundation for your test suite, saving time while ensuring good coverage of your application functionality.
