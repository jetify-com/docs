You can check out an [example repo](https://gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components-example) with our Gitlab integration for more details.

## Getting Started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting Started")

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A GitLab project with CI/CD enabled
- At least one Testpilot test file (`.pilot.yaml`) in your repository
- Access to GitLab runners (SaaS or self-hosted)

### Step 1: Create Your First Pipeline[​](#step-1-create-your-first-pipeline "Direct link to Step 1: Create Your First Pipeline")

Let's start by creating a simple GitLab CI pipeline that installs Testpilot and runs a test. Create or edit your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your project root:

```
# Include the Testpilot componentinclude:  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: install# Define pipeline stagesstages:  - install  - test# Your test jobrun-my-tests:  stage: test  needs: ["testpilot-install-linux-amd64"]  # Wait for Testpilot installation  script:    - ./bin/testpilot test your_test.pilot.yaml  # Replace with your test file  # preserve artifacts and reports  artifacts:    report:      junit: testpilot-out/*.xm<D-l><D-s>    paths:       - testpilot-out    when: always    expire_in: 1 week
```

### Step 2: Commit and Run[​](#step-2-commit-and-run "Direct link to Step 2: Commit and Run")

Now that you have your pipeline defined, let's run it:

1. Save your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
2. Commit and push to your GitLab repository
3. Navigate to your project's **CI/CD > Pipelines** section
4. Watch your pipeline run!

You should see two jobs:

- `testpilot-install-linux-amd64` - Downloads and sets up Testpilot
- `run-my-tests` - Runs your Testpilot tests

### Step 3: View your Artifacts[​](#step-3-view-your-artifacts "Direct link to Step 3: View your Artifacts")

The `artifacts` section of the job above will preserve a static report of your Testpilot tests, including images and videos. You can view it by browsing to the `Artifacts` section of your Gitlab project.

Testpilot also generates a JUnit report that can be directly reported to your merge requests

### Step 4: Understanding What Happened[​](#step-4-understanding-what-happened "Direct link to Step 4: Understanding What Happened")

The Testpilot component automatically:

- Downloaded the Testpilot installer
- Installed Testpilot and its dependencies (Playwright, Node.js)
- Created a `./bin/testpilot` launcher script
- Cached everything for faster future runs
- Made Testpilot available to your test job

## Platform-Specific Setup[​](#platform-specific-setup "Direct link to Platform-Specific Setup")

Testpilot supports running your tests on Linux and macOS runners. You can easily configure your pipeline to handle both platforms:

### Setting Up for Linux (Default)[​](#setting-up-for-linux-default "Direct link to Setting Up for Linux (Default)")

The component works out-of-the-box with GitLab's standard Linux runners. No additional configuration needed!

```
include:  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: installstages:  - install  - testrun-tests:  stage: test  needs: ["testpilot-install-linux-amd64"]  script:    - ./bin/testpilot test your_test.pilot.yaml
```

### Setting Up for macOS[​](#setting-up-for-macos "Direct link to Setting Up for macOS")

Since macOS runners can't (currently) run Docker Images directly, they require a slightly different setup. Here's how to configure your pipeline to use GitLab's SaaS macOS runners:

**Step 1:** Define your macOS runner configuration at the top of your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```
# macOS runner configuration.macos_saas_runners:  tags:    - saas-macos-medium-m1  # Use GitLab's SaaS macOS runners
```

**Step 2:** Include the component with macOS-specific settings:

```
# Include the Testpilot component for macOSinclude:    - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main        inputs:            stage: install                # Install Testpilot in the 'install' stage            platform: macos               # Target the macOS platform            runner-extends: .macos_saas_runners  # Use the macOS SaaS runner config# Define pipeline stagesstages:    - install    - test# Run your tests on macOSrun-tests-macos:    stage: test    extends: .macos_saas_runners          needs: ["testpilot-install-macos"]      script:        - ./bin/testpilot test your_test.pilot.yaml  # Replace with your test file
```

### Setting up Custom Runners[​](#setting-up-custom-runners "Direct link to Setting up Custom Runners")

If you're using self-hosted runners, you can configure Testpilot to run on them using a configuration like the following

```
# Custom runner configurations.arm_runner:  tags:  # custom runner configuration goes hereinclude:  # ARM64 runner  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: install      platform: linux-arm64      runner-extends: .arm_runnerstages:  - install  - testtest-arm:  stage: test  extends: .arm_runner  needs: ["testpilot-install-linux-arm64"]  script:    - ./bin/testpilot test tests/
```

## Multi-Platform Testing[​](#multi-platform-testing "Direct link to Multi-Platform Testing")

Want to test on both Linux and macOS? Here's how:

```
# Runner configurations.macos_saas_runners:  tags:    - saas-macos-medium-m1# Install Testpilot on both platformsinclude:  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: install      # platform: linux-amd64 is the default  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: install      platform: macos      runner-extends: .macos_saas_runnersstages:  - install  - test# Run tests on Linuxtest-linux:  stage: test  needs: ["testpilot-install-linux-amd64"]  script:    - ./bin/testpilot test tests/# Run tests on macOStest-macos:  stage: test  extends: .macos_saas_runners  needs: ["testpilot-install-macos"]  script:    - ./bin/testpilot test tests/
```

## Sharding your Tests and Running in Parallel[​](#sharding-your-tests-and-running-in-parallel "Direct link to Sharding your Tests and Running in Parallel")

Testpilot can shard your test files across multiple runners using the `--shard` flag, which is useful for parallelizing and speeding up your test runs. Note that after sharding and running your tests in parallel, you will probably want to merge the reports back together using `testpilot report merge`.

You can see an example of sharding testpilot files in our [example repo](https://gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components-example). An example gitlab.yaml file is below:

```
include:  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: install      xdg_cache_home: .cache/jetifystages:  - install  - test  - mergetestpilot_test:  stage: test  needs: ["testpilot-install-linux-amd64"]  parallel: 2  # Use built in CI_NODE environment variables to shard across runners  script: ./bin/testpilot test --outdir=testpilot-out-${CI_NODE_INDEX} --shard=${CI_NODE_INDEX}/${CI_NODE_TOTAL} --reporters=junit  artifacts:    reports:      junit: testpilot-out/*.xml    paths:      - testpilot-out-${CI_NODE_INDEX}/    when: always    expire_in: 1 week# Merge your test reports together into a single artifacttestpilot_merge:  stage: merge  needs:    - "testpilot-install-linux-amd64"    - job: "testpilot_test"      artifacts: true      optional: true  script: ./bin/testpilot report merge --outdir=testpilot-out testpilot-out-*  artifacts:    paths:      - testpilot-out/    when: always    expire_in: 1 week
```

## Understanding the Component[​](#understanding-the-component "Direct link to Understanding the Component")

### Behind the Scenes[​](#behind-the-scenes "Direct link to Behind the Scenes")

When you include the Testpilot component, it creates a job that:

1. **Downloads the installer** from `https://get.jetify.com/testpilot`
2. **Installs Testpilot** and its dependencies (Playwright, Node.js)
3. **Creates a launcher script** at `./bin/testpilot` that handles environment setup
4. **Caches everything** so future pipeline runs are faster
5. **Shares the installation** with your test jobs via GitLab artifacts

### Component Configuration Options[​](#component-configuration-options "Direct link to Component Configuration Options")

The component accepts these parameters:

| Parameter        | Required | Default       | Description                         | Example                |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `stage`          | ✅ Yes   | -             | Which stage to install Testpilot in | `install`              |
| `platform`       | No       | `linux-amd64` | Target platform                     | `macos`, `linux-arm64` |
| `runner-extends` | No       | -             | Custom runner configuration         | `.macos_saas_runners`  |
| `xdg_cache_home` | No       | `.cache`      | Cache directory location            | `.custom_cache`        |

## Caching and Performance[​](#caching-and-performance "Direct link to Caching and Performance")

### Caching Strategy[​](#caching-strategy "Direct link to Caching Strategy")

The component automatically caches:

- The Testpilot binary and dependencies
- Your `./bin/testpilot` launcher script

This means the second time your pipeline runs, Testpilot installation will be much faster!

### Custom Cache Directory[​](#custom-cache-directory "Direct link to Custom Cache Directory")

If you need to change where files are cached:

```
include:  - component: gitlab.com/jetify-com/gitlab-components/testpilot_install@main    inputs:      stage: install      xdg_cache_home: .my_custom_cacherun-tests:  stage: test  needs: ["testpilot-install-linux-amd64"]  script:    - ./bin/testpilot test tests/
```

## Best Practices Summary[​](#best-practices-summary "Direct link to Best Practices Summary")

✅ **Do:**

- Always use `needs:` to ensure proper job dependencies
- Leverage the built-in caching for faster pipelines
- Use descriptive job names that reflect what you're testing
- Test on multiple platforms if your application supports them
- Structure your tests in logical directories

❌ **Don't:**

- Forget to specify the correct job name in `needs:`
- Modify the cache directory unless necessary
- Run tests without waiting for the installation job
- Use the same job name for multiple platforms
