üöÄ Features & Improvements

- **Extra Cookie Support**
  - Added ability to set custom cookie data during tests using the `TESTPILOT_EXTRA_COOKIE_DATA`
    environment variable

- **Experimental Action Cache**
  - Introduced an experimental action cache feature to store and reuse actions based on element IDs,
    improving test performance and reliability
  - Users will need to be signed in to their Jetify Cloud account with `testpilot auth login` to
    utilize this feature, and can update the cache using the `--upload-report` flag during test
  - This feature can be enabled with the `FEATURE_FLAG_USE_CACHE_FOR_FAST_EXECUTION` environment
    variable.

üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Screenshot Handling:**
  - Fixed nil-pointer error when checking click elements prior to taking screenshots
  - Fixed mobile viewport screenshot issues affecting test accuracy
  - Improved screenshot timing for click actions on certain elements

- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Significantly improved cache hit rates (from \~20% to 50% in some cases) through enhanced
    element selection logic
  - Reduced image I/O operations to improve performance
  - Prevented continuous growth of screenshots in cached test reports

- **Element Selection:**
  - Enhanced element filtering to prioritize interactive elements, navigational elements, and
    elements with test identifiers
  - Improved selector preference logic, prioritizing aria-label attributes over CSS class selectors
  - Fixed element selection for dropdown/select actions to use values instead of indices for better
    cache reliability

- **Concurrency & Stability:**
  - Fixed race conditions with report protocol calls by adding proper locking
  - Fixed terminal output handling in concurrency mode for multi-viewport test cases
  - Fixed nil-pointer errors in LLM response handling

- **Login & Authentication:**
  - Improved login test reliability by using API service-hosted login pages
  - Enhanced login password redaction in test reports and JUnit reports for better security

- **Loading Timeouts**
  - Set Playwright page navigation timeout to 10 seconds for more reliable page loading
  - Testpilot will no longer fail a test if a page takes longer than 10 seconds to load, but will
    attempt to continue with the test.
