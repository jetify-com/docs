## Setting Up CI/CD Testing

When integrating Testpilot with your CI/CD pipeline, you'll typically:

1. Install Testpilot in your CI environment
2. Configure your API credentials as secrets
3. Run your test suite as part of your pipeline
4. Collect and publish test results

Each integration guide provides specific instructions for your platform.
