  "Testpilot can integrate with  to automatically generate email addresses and inboxes for your
  tests. This feature is especially useful for testing flows that involve email registration or
  account creation. Testpilot can also check your mailosaur inbox to retrieve OTP codes, magic
  links, and other email-based authentication methods."

## How It Works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

When your tests need an email address, Testpilot can:

1. Automatically generate a unique Mailosaur email address
2. Use this email to receive real emails during test execution
3. Access the inbox to retrieve verification codes, magic links, or other information
4. Complete the authentication or verification flow automatically

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

### 1. Create a Mailosaur Account[​](#1-create-a-mailosaur-account "Direct link to 1. Create a Mailosaur Account")

If you don't already have one, [sign up for a Mailosaur account](https://mailosaur.com/sign-up/) and
retrieve your API credentials. You will need a Mailosaur API Key and Server ID to configure
Testpilot.

### 3. Set Environment Variables[​](#3-set-environment-variables "Direct link to 3. Set Environment Variables")

Configure Testpilot to use your Mailosaur account by setting these environment variables:

```
export MAILOSAUR_API_KEY=your_api_keyexport MAILOSAUR_SERVER_ID=your_server_id
```

In CI environments, add these to your secure environment variables.

## Using Generated Emails in Tests[​](#using-generated-emails-in-tests "Direct link to Using Generated Emails in Tests")

Once configured, Testpilot will automatically handle email generation. You don't need to explicitly
specify email addresses in your test scenarios - Testpilot will generate and use them as needed. For
example, you can test a signup flow using a unique, randomly generated email as shown below:

### Example Test Scenario[​](#example-test-scenario "Direct link to Example Test Scenario")

````
cases:  id: email_signup_0001  name: Sign up with email verification  description: Use a random email to test the signup flow  url: https://zillow.com/signup  steps:    - Click Create Account    - Enter an email address to signup for an account    - Enter a password  - ```## Manually Specifying Email AddressesIf you prefer not to use the Mailosaur integration, you can explicitly specify email addresses in your test scenarios:```yaml### Example Test Scenariocases:  id: email_signup_0001  name: Sign up with email verification  description: Use a random email to test the signup flow  url: https://zillow.com/signup  steps:    - Click Create Account    - Sign up for an account with email address "test123@example-email.com"    - Enter a password
````

Note that without Mailosaur integration, Testpilot won't be able to automatically check inboxes or
handle email verification flows, unless you design a test case specifically for this workflow.
