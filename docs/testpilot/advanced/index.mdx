This section covers advanced Testpilot features designed for specific use cases and power users. These features are optional but powerful tools that can enhance your testing workflow.

<Note>
Before exploring advanced features, you should be comfortable with the basics covered in [Getting Started](/docs/testpilot/getting-started). These features are designed for users who have already run tests successfully and want to extend Testpilot's capabilities.

## What You'll Find Here

Advanced features include AI-powered test generation and extensibility through the Model Context Protocol. These capabilities are designed for specific workflows and may not be necessary for all users.

## When to Use Advanced Features

Consider using advanced features when:

- **AI Test Generation**: You want to quickly create test plans from descriptions or need inspiration for test scenarios
- **MCP Integration**: You need to integrate with custom APIs, internal tools, or specialized testing infrastructure

These features complement the core testing workflow but are not required for effective testing with Testpilot.
