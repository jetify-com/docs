## General Tips[​](#general-tips "Direct link to General Tips")

- When writing tests, start by providing general steps, and only get more specific or add context as
  needed. General steps give Testpilot more flexibility, and can lead to faster tests.
- If you need to check that something is present on the page before proceeding, start your step with
  "Verify" or "Check". This tells Testpilot that you want to make an assertion about the page's
  state.

## Speeding up Tests[​](#speeding-up-tests "Direct link to Speeding up Tests")

- Testpilot automatically handles launching the app or website provided via the `url` or
  `platform_config` fields in the test. You don't need to add steps like "Wait for the application
  to load," "Launch the app," or "Verify that the app launches successfully."

- Consolidate steps wherever possible. Tests with fewer steps run faster because Testpilot needs to
  capture an initial screenshot for each step and generate results after the test completes.

- Avoid adding "Verify" or "Check" type assertion steps when you can use an action instead. You
  don't need to verify that a text box is present if the next step is to click the text box.

- For example — you can rewrite the following test steps:

  ```
  - Verify that you can see the login form- Click the login form- Verify that the login form is active- Enter your login information
  ```

  into:

  ```
  - Enter your login information in the form
  ```

## Using Context[​](#using-context "Direct link to Using Context")

- Use context fields to provide important information that Testpilot needs for your test case.
  Examples include:
  - **Describing less common UI features or gestures**. For example: "If you see a Welcome Screen
    pop-up in the flow, click the 'Not Interested' button to dismiss it."
  - **Providing user information for Testpilot to model**. For example: "You are a new homeowner
    with a $200,000 mortgage in Cincinnati, Ohio" helps Testpilot fill out the right details in an
    application form.
  - **Giving Testpilot permission for certain actions**. For example: "You should grant location
    permissions whenever prompted" or "You are authorized to accept terms of service and submit loan
    applications."

- If you need to provide context that applies to multiple test cases, consider using the `context`
  field at the test file level. This way, you can avoid repeating the same context in each test
  case. If the context is only relevant to a single test case, you can use the `context` field at
  the test case level.

- Testpilot responds better to concise, direct context blocks. Instead of writing long paragraphs,
  break important context into separate lines and remove unnecessary text.

- Avoid using context to provide instructions that Testpilot can infer from the steps. For example,
  you don't need to say "You are a user" or "You are testing the application" because Testpilot
  already knows this.
