Writing high-quality tests ensures your test suite is reliable, maintainable, and provides meaningful feedback. This section shares best practices and patterns for getting the most out of Testpilot.

## Testpilot's Testing Philosophy

Testpilot uses AI to test applications visually, the way humans do. This means you should write tests like you would describe actions to a person:

- Describe what you want to accomplish, not how to find specific elements
- Start with general instructions and add specificity only when needed
- Let Testpilot handle the visual navigation and element identification

This approach creates tests that are more resilient to UI changes and easier to maintain.

## What You'll Find Here

This section provides guidance on writing effective tests, optimizing test performance, and maintaining your test suite over time.

## Key Principles

- **Write for humans first**: Test steps should be readable and understandable
- **Be flexible**: General instructions give Testpilot more flexibility to adapt to UI changes
- **Consolidate steps**: Fewer steps mean faster tests and clearer intent
- **Use context wisely**: Provide additional information only when necessary
