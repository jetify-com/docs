If you are using Oh My Zsh, just run the following:

```
mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/completionsdevbox completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_devbox
```

If you are not using Oh My Zsh and shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you
will need to enable it. You can execute the following once:

```
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions in your current shell session:

```bash
source <(devbox completion zsh); compdef _devbox devbox
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

## Linux[​](#linux "Direct link to Linux")

```bash
devbox completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_devbox"
```

## macOS[​](#macos "Direct link to macOS")

```bash
devbox completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_devbox
```

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

```bash
devbox completion zsh [flags]
```
