## Adding Elixir to your project[​](#adding-elixir-to-your-project "Direct link to Adding Elixir to your project")

`devbox add elixir`, or add the following to your `devbox.json`

```
    "packages": [        "elixir@latest"    ],
```

This will install the latest version of Elixir. You can find other installable versions of Elixir by
running `devbox search elixir`. You can also search for Elixir on
[Nixhub](https://www.nixhub.io/packages/elixir)

## Elixir Plugin Support[​](#elixir-plugin-support "Direct link to Elixir Plugin Support")

Devbox will automatically use the following configuration when you install Elixir with `devbox add`.

### Environment Variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

`$MIX_HOME` and `$HEX_HOME` configure Mix/Hex to install artifacts locally, while `$ERL_AFLAGS`
enables shell history in `iex`:

```bash
MIX_HOME={PROJECT_DIR}/.devbox/virtenv/elixir/mixHEX_HOME={PROJECT_DIR}/.devbox/virtenv/elixir/hexERL_AFLAGS="-kernel shell_history enabled"
```

### Disabling the Elixir Plugin[​](#disabling-the-elixir-plugin "Direct link to Disabling the Elixir Plugin")

You can disable the Elixir plugin by running `devbox add elixir --disable-plugin`, or by setting the
`disable_plugin` field in your `devbox.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": {
    "elixir": {
      "version": "latest",
      "disable_plugin": true
    }
  }
}
```

Note that disabling the plugin will cause Mix and Hex to cache artifacts globally in the user's home
directory (at `~/.mix/` and `~/.hex/`). This might actually be preferable if you're developing
several Elixir projects and want to benefit from caching, but does defeat the isolation guarantees
of Devbox.

If the plugin is disabled, it's recommended to manually set `$ERL_AFLAGS` to preserve `iex` shell
history:

```
    "env": {      "ERL_AFLAGS": "-kernel shell_history enabled"    }
```
