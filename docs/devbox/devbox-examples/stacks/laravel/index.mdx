This example shows how to build a simple Laravel application backed by MariaDB and Redis. It uses
Devbox Plugins for all 3 Nix packages to simplify configuration

[Example Repo](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox/tree/main/examples/stacks/laravel)

## How to Run[​](#how-to-run "Direct link to How to Run")

1. Install [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing-devbox/)

2. Create a new Laravel App by running `devbox create --template laravel`. This will create a new
   Laravel project in your current directory.

3. Start your MariaDB and Redis services by running `devbox services up`.
   1. This step will also create an empty MariaDB Data Directory and initialize your database with
      the default settings
   2. This will also start the php-fpm service for serving your PHP project over fcgi. Learn more
      about [PHP-FPM](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php)

4. Create the laravel database by running `devbox run db:create`, and then run Laravel's initial
   migrations using `devbox run db:migrate`

5. You can now start the artisan server by running `devbox run serve:dev`. This will start the
   server on port 8000, which you can access at `localhost:8000`

6. If you're using Laravel on Devbox Cloud, you can test the app by appending `/port/8000` to your
   Devbox Cloud URL

## How to Recreate this Example[​](#how-to-recreate-this-example "Direct link to How to Recreate this Example")

### Creating the Laravel Project[​](#creating-the-laravel-project "Direct link to Creating the Laravel Project")

1. Create a new project with `devbox init`

2. Add the packages using the command below. Installing the packages with `devbox add` will ensure
   that the plugins are activated:

   ```bash
   devbox add mariadb@latest, [email protected], nodejs@18, redis@latest, php81Packages.composer@latest
```bash

3. Run `devbox shell` to start your shell. This will also initialize your database by running
   `initdb` in the init hook.

4. Create your laravel project by running:

   ```
   composer create-project laravel/laravel tmpmv tmp/* tmp/.* .
```bash

### Setting up MariaDB[​](#setting-up-mariadb "Direct link to Setting up MariaDB")

To use MariaDB, you need to create the default Laravel database. You can do this by running the
following commands in your `devbox shell`:

```
# Start the MariaDB servicedevbox services up mariadb -b# Create the databasemysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE laravel;"# Once you're done, stop the MariaDB servicedevbox services stop mariadb
```bash
