## Adding RabbitMQ to your shell[​](#adding-rabbitmq-to-your-shell "Direct link to Adding RabbitMQ to your shell")

You can start by adding the RabbitMQ server to your project by running `devbox add rabbitmq-server`.

```
    "packages": [        "rabbitmq-server@latest"    ]
```

You can then add the RabbitMQ Plugin to your devbox.json by adding it to your `include` list:

```
    "include": [        "github:jetify-com/devbox-plugins?dir=rabbitmq"    ]
```

Adding these packages and the plugin will configure Devbox for working with RabbitMQ.

## Starting the RabbitMQ Service[​](#starting-the-rabbitmq-service "Direct link to Starting the RabbitMQ Service")

The RabbitMQ plugin will automatically create a service for you that can be run with
`devbox services up`. The process-compose.yaml for this service is shown below:

```
processes:  rabbitmq:    command: "rabbitmq-server"    availability:      restart: on_failure      max_restarts: 5    daemon: true    shutdown:      command: "rabbitmqctl shutdown"  rabbitmq-logs:    command: "tail -f $RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE/$RABBITMQ_NODENAME@$(hostname -s).log"    availability:      restart: "always"
```

The `rabbitmq` process starts the server as a daemon in the background, and shuts it down whenever
you terminate process compose. The `rabbitmq-logs` service will tail the logs of process-compose,
and display them in the process-compose UI. You can configure the services by modifying the
environment variables as described below.

If you want to create your own version of the RabbitMQ service, you can create a
process-compose.yaml in your project's root, and define a new process named `rabbitmq`. For more
details, see the [process-compose documentation](https://f1bonacc1.github.io/process-compose/)

## Environment Variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

The plugin will create the following environment variables:

```
RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE = {{.DevboxDir}}/conf.d# Points to the directory containing your rabbitmq.conf fileRABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE = {{.Virtenv}}/mnesia# Points to the directory where your node database store, and state files will be kept. Changing this variable is not recommendedRABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE = {{.DevboxDir}}/conf.d/enabled_plugins# Tells rabbit mq where to store the file with your enabled pluginsRABBITMQ_LOG_BASE = {{.Virtenv}}/log# Where the logs for your RabbitMQ instance will be storedRABBITMQ_NODENAME = rabbit# Default nodename for your rabbitmq instance. This variable is used in other settingsRABBITMQ_PID_FILE = {{.Virtenv}}/pid/$RABBITMQ_NODENAME.pid# Creates RabbitMQ's pidfile in a local directory for your project. Changing this is not recommended.
```

You can override the default values of these variables using the `env` section of your `devbox.json`
file. For a full list of environment variables used by RabbitMQ, see the
[RabbitMQ Configuration Docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#customise-environment).

## Files[​](#files "Direct link to Files")

The plugin will also create a default
[`rabbitmq.conf`](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox-plugins/blob/main/rabbitmq/config/rabbitmq.conf)
file in your devbox.d directory, if one doesn't already exist there. This default file serves as a
starting point, and you can modify it as needed.

For a full list of configuration options, see the
[RabbitMQ Configuration Docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure)
