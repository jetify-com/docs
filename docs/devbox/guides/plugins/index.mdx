title: "Using Plugins"
description:
  "This doc describes how to use Devbox Plugins with your project.  provide a default Devbox
  configuration for a Nix package. Plugins make it easier to get started with packages that require
  additional setup when installed with Nix, and they offer a familiar interface for configuring
  packages. They also help keep all of your project's configuration within your project directory,
  which helps maintain portability and isolation."

## Using Plugins[​](#using-plugins "Direct link to Using Plugins")

### Built-in Plugins[​](#built-in-plugins "Direct link to Built-in Plugins")

If you add one of the packages listed below to your project using `devbox add <pkg>`, Devbox will
automatically activate the plugin for that package.

You can also explicitly add a built-in plugin in your project by adding it to the
[`include` section](/docs/devbox/configuration/#include) of your `devbox.json` file. For example, to
explicitly add the plugin for Nginx, you can add the following to your `devbox.json` file:

```json
{ "include": ["plugin:nginx"] }
```

Built-in plugins are available for the following packages. You can activate the plugins for these
packages by running `devbox add <package_name>`

- [Apache](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/servers/apache/) (apacheHttpd)
- [Caddy](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/servers/caddy/) (caddy)
- [Nginx](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/servers/nginx/) (nginx)
- [Node.js](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/languages/nodejs/) (nodejs, nodejs-slim)
- [MariaDB](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/mariadb/) (mariadb, mariadb_10_6...)
- [MySQL](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/mysql/) (mysql80, mysql57)
- [PostgreSQL](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/postgres/) (postgresql)
- [Redis](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/redis/) (redis)
- [Valkey](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/valkey/) (valkey)
- [PHP](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/languages/php/) (php, php80, php81, php82...)
- [Python](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/languages/python/) (python, python-full, python-minimal...)
- [Ruby](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/languages/ruby/)(ruby, ruby_3_1, ruby_3_0...)
- [Elixir](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/languages/elixir/)(elixir, elixir_1_16, elixir_1_15...)

### Local Plugins[​](#local-plugins "Direct link to Local Plugins")

You can also [define your own plugins](/docs/devbox/guides/creating-plugins/) and use them in your
project. To use a local plugin, add the following to the `include` section of your devbox.json:

```
  "include": [    "path:./path/to/plugin.json"  ]
```

### Github Hosted Plugins[​](#github-hosted-plugins "Direct link to Github Hosted Plugins")

Sometimes, you may want to share a plugin across multiple projects or users. In this case, you
provide a Github reference to a plugin hosted on Github. To install a github hosted plugin, add the
following to the include section of your devbox.json

Default - `master` branch:
```
  "include": [    "github:<org>/<repo>?dir=<plugin-dir>"  ]
```

Branch override:
```
  "include": [    "github:<org>/<repo>/<branch>?dir=<plugin-dir>"  ]
```

Git Tag Pinning:
```
  "include": [    "github:<org>/<repo>/tags/<tag-to-pin>?dir=<plugin-dir>"  ]
```

Note that Devbox will cache Github plugins for 24 hours. This is to aid performance of
`devbox shell` and similar commands, and avoids downloading the plugin from Github each time. In
extenuating circumstances, you can bypass this cache by setting
`export DEVBOX_X_GITHUB_PLUGIN_CACHE_TTL=<time>` , where time is a valid input to
`time.ParseDuration` (see [doc](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)) such as "120s" or "2m".

## An Example of a Plugin: Nginx[​](#an-example-of-a-plugin-nginx "Direct link to An Example of a Plugin: Nginx")

Let's take a look at the plugin for Nginx. To get started, let's initialize a new devbox project,
and add the `nginx` package:

```bash
cd ~/my_proj
devbox init && devbox add nginx
```

Devbox will install the package, activate the `nginx` plugin, and print a short explanation of the
plugin's configuration

```bash
Installing nix packages. This may take a while... done.

nginx NOTES:
nginx can be configured with env variables

To customize:
* Use $NGINX_CONFDIR to change the configuration directory
* Use $NGINX_LOGDIR to change the log directory
* Use $NGINX_PIDDIR to change the pid directory
* Use $NGINX_RUNDIR to change the run directory
* Use $NGINX_SITESDIR to change the sites directory
* Use $NGINX_TMPDIR to change the tmp directory
* Use $NGINX_USER to change the user
* Use $NGINX_GROUP to customize.

Services:
* nginx

Use `devbox services start|stop [service]` to interact with services

This plugin creates the following helper files:
* ~/my_project/devbox.d/nginx/nginx.conf
* ~/my_project/devbox.d/nginx/fastcgi.conf
* ~/my_project/devbox.d/web/index.html

This plugin sets the following environment variables:
* NGINX_CONFDIR=~/my_project/devbox.d/nginx/nginx.conf
* NGINX_PATH_PREFIX=~/my_project/.devbox/virtenv/nginx
* NGINX_TMPDIR=~/my_project/.devbox/virtenv/nginx/temp

To show this information, run `devbox info nginx`

nginx (nginx-1.22.1) is now installed.
```

Based on this info page, we can see that Devbox has created the configuration we need to run `nginx`
in our local shell. Let's take a look at the files it created:

```
% tree .
├── devbox.d
│   ├── nginx
│   │   ├── fastcgi.conf
│   │   └── nginx.conf
│   └── web
│       └── index.html
└── devbox.json
```

These files give us everything we need to run NGINX, and we can modify the `nginx.conf` and
`fastcgi.conf` to customize how Nginx works.

We can also see in the info page that Devbox has configured an NGINX service for us. Let's start
this service with `devbox services start nginx`, and then test it with `curl`:

```bash
> devbox services start nginx
Installing nix packages. This may take a while... done.
Starting a devbox shell...
Service "nginx" started

> curl localhost:80
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello World!
  </body>
</html>
```

## Plugin Configuration in detail[​](#plugin-configuration-in-detail "Direct link to Plugin Configuration in detail")

When Devbox detects a plugin for an installed package, it automatically applies its configuration
and prints a short explanation. Developers can review this explanation anytime using
`devbox info <package_name>`.

### Services[​](#services "Direct link to Services")

If your package can run as a daemon or background service, Devbox can configure and manage that
service for you with `devbox services`.

To learn more, visit our page on [Devbox Services](/docs/devbox/guides/services/).

### Environment Variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

Devbox stores default environment variables for your package in
`.devbox/virtenv/<package_name>/.env` in your project directory. Devbox automatically updates these
environment variables whenever you run `devbox shell` or `devbox run` to match your current project,
and developers should not check these `.env` files into source control.

#### Customizing Environment Variables[​](#customizing-environment-variables "Direct link to Customizing Environment Variables")

If you want to customize the environment variables, you can override them in the `init_hook` of your
`devbox.json`

### Helper Files[​](#helper-files "Direct link to Helper Files")

Helper files are files that your package may use for configuration purposes, such as NGINX's
`nginx.conf` file. When installing a package, Devbox will check for helper files in your project's
`devbox.d` folder and create them if they do not exist. If helper files are already present, Devbox
will not overwrite them.

#### Customizing Helper Files[​](#customizing-helper-files "Direct link to Customizing Helper Files")

Developers should directly edit helper files and check them into source control if needed

## Plugins Source Code[​](#plugins-source-code "Direct link to Plugins Source Code")

Devbox Plugins are written in JSON and stored in the main Devbox Repo. You can view the source code
of the current plugins [here](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox/tree/main/plugins)
