title: "Running Services"
description:
  "When working on an application, you often want some services or dependencies running in the
  background for testing. Take a web app as an example. While working on your application, you will
  want to test it against a running development server and database. Previously developers would
  manage these services via tools like Docker Compose or orchestrating them manually."
---

With Devbox, you can manage these services from the CLI using `devbox services`. Devbox uses
[process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose#-launcher) under the hood to start
and manage your project's services.

## Starting your Services[​](#starting-your-services "Direct link to Starting your Services")

You can start all the services in your project by running `devbox services up`. This will start
process-compose in the foreground, and start all the services associated with your project:

![Process Compose running in the foreground](./process-compose-tui-interface.png)

You can also start a specific service by passing the name as an argument. For example, to start just
`postgresql`, you can run `devbox services up postgresql`

If you want to restart your services (for example, after changing your configuration), you can run
`devbox services restart`

## Starting your Services in the Background[​](#starting-your-services-in-the-background "Direct link to Starting your Services in the Background")

If you want to start your services in the background, without launching the process-compose TUI, you
can use the `-b` flag. For example, to start all services in the background, you can run
`devbox services up -b`.

Services started in the background will continue running, even if the current shell is closed. To
stop your backgrounded services, run `devbox services stop`.

To see the current state of your running services, you can run `devbox services ls`.

You can also attach the process-compose TUI to your running background services by running
`devbox services attach`.

## Defining your Own Services[​](#defining-your-own-services "Direct link to Defining your Own Services")

If you have a process or service that you want to run with your Devbox project, you can define it
using a process-compose.yml in your project's root directory. For example, if you want to run a
Django server, you could add the following yaml:

```yaml
# Process compose for starting django
version: "0.5"
processes:
  django:
   command: python todo_project/manage.py runserver
   availability:
    restart: "always"
```

This will now start your django service whenever you run `devbox services up`.

## Plugins that Support Services[​](#plugins-that-support-services "Direct link to Plugins that Support Services")

The following plugins provide a pre-configured service that can be managed with `devbox services`:

- [Apache](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/servers/apache/) (apacheHttpd)
- [Caddy](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/servers/caddy/) (caddy)
- [Nginx](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/servers/nginx/) (nginx)
- [PostgreSQL](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/postgres/) (postgresql)
- [Redis](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/redis/) (redis)
- [Valkey](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/databases/valkey/) (valkey)
- [PHP](/docs/devbox/devbox-examples/languages/php/) (php, php80, php81, php82)

The service will be made available to your project when you install the packages using `devbox add`.

## Listing the Services in our Project[​](#listing-the-services-in-our-project "Direct link to Listing the Services in our Project")

You can list all the services available to your current devbox project by running
`devbox services ls`. For example, the services in a PHP web app project might look like this:

```text
devbox services ls
No services currently running. Run `devbox services up` to start them:
  django
  postgresql
```

If process-compose is already running, `devbox services ls` will show you the list of services
registered with process-compose and their current status

```text
Services running in process-compose:
NAME              STATUS          EXIT CODE
django            Running         0
postgresql        Launched        0
```

## Stopping your services[​](#stopping-your-services "Direct link to Stopping your services")

You can stop your services with `devbox services stop`. This will stop process-compose, as well as
all the running services associated with your project.

If you want to stop a specific service, you can pass the name as an argument. For example, to stop
just `postgresql`, you can run `devbox services stop postgresql`
