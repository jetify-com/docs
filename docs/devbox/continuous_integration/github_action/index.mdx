This GitHub Action also supports caching the packages and dependencies installed in your
`devbox.json`, which can significantly improve CI build times.

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

`devbox-install-action` is available on the
[GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/devbox-installer)

In your project's workflow YAML, add the following step:

```bash
- name: Install devbox  uses: jetify-com/devbox-install-[email protected]
```

## Example Workflow[​](#example-workflow "Direct link to Example Workflow")

The workflow below shows how to use the action to install Devbox, and then run arbitrary commands or
[Devbox Scripts](/docs/devbox/guides/scripts/) in your shell.

```bash
name: Testing with devboxon: pushjobs:  test:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - uses: actions/checkout@v4      - name: Install devbox        uses: jetify-com/devbox-install-[email protected]      - name: Run arbitrary commands        run: devbox run -- echo "done!"      - name: Run a script called test        run: devbox run test
```

## Configuring the Action[​](#configuring-the-action "Direct link to Configuring the Action")

See the [GitHub Marketplace page](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/devbox-installer) for the
latest configuration settings and an example.

For stability over new features and bug fixes, consider pinning `devbox-version`. Remember to update
this pinned version when you update your local Devbox via `devbox version update`.
