  "Jetify Cloud will automatically configure a unique, private domain for previewing your deployed
  application. For production purposes, you will probably want to add a more user friendly domain to
  route users to your application. Jetify will also configure and issue an SSL certificate for your
  domain automatically."

<Info>
  You will need access to the DNS records for your Domain in order to configure it for Jetify Cloud.

3. Enter the custom domain name that you would like to use for your project

   domain, you will need to add a record to your DNS provider:

5. Once the correct records have been added to your DNS provider, your Custom Domain will display an
   **Issued** status:
   ![Custom Domain Issued](./custom-domain-status-issued.png)
