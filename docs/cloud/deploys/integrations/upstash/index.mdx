  "Upstash provides a managed Key-value store that is compatible with the Redis API. You can use
  Upstash Redis as a cache or key-value store for serverless or stateless deployments like Jetify
  Cloud. For more information, consult the"

You can view an example of this integration on

## Using Upstash Redis with Jetify Cloud[​](#using-upstash-redis-with-jetify-cloud "Direct link to Using Upstash Redis with Jetify Cloud")

- [Create a Redis Database](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted) in Upstash. Select
  the Database's name and region, and then click the Create button
  - If you don't already have an Upstash account, you can create a free one to test with Jetify
    Cloud
- After clicking the Create button, you'll see a page with the connection details for your Database.
  Copy the Endpoint, Password, and Port -- you'll need these to connect from Jetify Cloud.

- Go to the Jetify Dashboard for your project, and navigate to Secrets. Create the following Secrets
  in the `Prod` environment:
  - `REDIS_HOST`: your Upstash DB Endpoint URL
  - `REDIS_PASSWORD`: your Upstash DB Password
  - `REDIS_PORT`: your Upstash DB Port

<Info>
  If you want to use your Database locally or in a preview environment, you can also set these
  environment variables for the `dev` and `preview` environment
</Info>

When you deploy your application, Devbox will automatically set these secrets as env variables in
your environment. You can then access them using any redis client.

For example, if you are connecting from a Python app, you can do something like the following to
connect from a Redis client.

```python
import os
import redis

redis_cache = redis.StrictRedis(
    host=os.getenv('REDIS_HOST'),
    password=os.getenv('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
    port=os.getenv('REDIS_PORT'),
    ssl=True
)
```
