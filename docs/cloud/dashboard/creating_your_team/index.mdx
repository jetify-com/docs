  "Developers who want to use Jetify for their personal projects can sign up for a free account. The
  free account comes with basic Jetify Cloud features (like Secrets), with additional features like
  Deployments and Cache available for purchase."

If you want to collaborate and share your projects with other members on your team, you will need to
upgrade to a **Team Account**. Team accounts let you invite other developers to share resources and
collaborate on projects in Jetify Cloud.

Users with a free account can upgrade to a paid team on the dashboard anytime.

## Creating a New Team Account[​](#creating-a-new-team-account "Direct link to Creating a New Team Account")

## Billing[​](#billing "Direct link to Billing")

Free accounts are free forever. You will need to add a payment method to unlock paid tier features.

Team accounts are billed monthly based on the number of active members in your team. You can view
your current billing status and update your billing information from the **Billing** tab in the
Jetify Dashboard.
