  "If you have a paid Team project, you can invite team members to join your project. Team members
  can configure and use your project’s secrets when developing using the Devbox or Envsec CLI."

<Info>
  If you want to invite team members to your projects, you will need to add a payment option and
  upgrade your account to a Starter Plan. For more details, see our [Plans and
  Pricing](https://www.jetify.com/cloud/pricing).

Team members can be added in one of two Roles:

- **Member:** Members can access or add projects, as well as access or modify the secrets for their
  projects
- **Admins:** Have all the permissions of Members, but can also invite new team members and
  configure project billing
