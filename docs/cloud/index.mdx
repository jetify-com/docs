<Info>
  Jetify Cloud is currently available in Early Access. We're actively working on adding new features
  and improving the platform. To learn more, share your feedback, or follow our progress, join our
  [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/jetify).
</Info>

Jetify Cloud currently includes:

**[Jetify Cache](/docs/cloud/cache/)**: Provides a secure, private cache to share packages across
all your Devbox projects and environments, whether sourced from Nixpkgs or Flakes. Avoid rebuilding
custom packages locally or in CI.

**[Jetify Secrets](/docs/cloud/secrets/)**: Securely store secrets and variables for all of your
environments, and automatically synchronize them with your Devbox Shells and Scripts.

More features are coming soon, keep an eye on our [**blog**](https://www.jetify.com/blog) for future
updates!
